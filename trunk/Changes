Release 1.3 (2014-09-03):
- Fixed inefficiencies in asm fast path for ARM.
- Revised detection of NaNs and infinities in Z.of_float
- Suppress the redundant fast paths written in C if a corresponding
  fast path exists in asm.
- Use <stdint.h> to ensure compatibility with OCaml 4.02.
- More prudent implementation of Z.of_int, avoids GC problem
  with OCaml < 4.02 (PR#6501 in the OCaml bug tracker).
